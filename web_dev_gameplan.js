Required To Know Technologies - Developer List 

* Learn How Client & Server Talk to Each Other
	
	* FTP (Protocols) & Web Host Setup
		FTP - stands for File Transfer Protocal
			Used to transfer files between computers and networks/account via online. FTP is a set of conventions that can be used by an "electronic communications system" to transfer files.

			There are many types of FTP protocols. 
			Browsers only use one type of FTP: 
				
			FTPS - works the same as FTP but encrypts everything, most servers use this now. 
				
			There are other protocols that collectively make up the internet. ex. IMAP, POP - send and recieve messages, XMPP - used for instant messages, DNS - used to translate domain names into IP addresses.

			How FTP Works
			FTP servers offer access to a firectory, with sub-directories. Users connect to these servers with an FTP client. 

			FTP clients - software that lets you download and upload files from and to a server. 

			FTP is a way of moving information from the computer you're working on to the server where a website is hosted. It is also used as a way to share files. Upload a file to an ftp server, then share a link with another person. 

			What does FTP look like? 
			It looks like the other files on your computer. There is a hierarchial folder structure that you can explore. 

			Is FTP secure? 
			Not by design, meaning FTP transfers aren't encrypted so thing can be intercepted via packet sniffing. 

			HTTP/HTTPS
		

		Web Hosting - activity or business of providing space and access for websites.

Road Map Break Down

1) Lets start with Front End Engineering and UX/UI Design

* Front-End Development 
	Q3 2017 

	- (HTML)
	- (CSS)
		+ Precompilers: (SASS) / LESS / Stylus
		+ Frameworks: (Bootstrap) / (Foundation) / (Materialize) 
		+ Responsive Design 

	- JavaScript - use this to change HTML and CSS
		+ ES6/ES2015
		+ Babel
		@ Task Runners : Gulp / Grunt
		+ Dependency Management : Browserify / (Webpack)
		@ Front-End Build Tools : Bower / package managment / Yeoman.io
		+ JS Frameworks : 

			- (React) :
				- Mobx :
					small applications
				- (Flux)
				- Redux
				- Relay :
					big applications
				- create-react-app : 
					help spin up a quick react app

			- (Angular)
			- Ember
			- Vue

			Challenge Yourself 
			- Clojurescript
			- Elm

			Unit Testing
			- Mocha
			- Jasmine
			- Karma
			- enzyme:
				test react 
			
		- jQuery

* UX/UI Deign
	Q4 2017



2) Back End Development
