========== MongoDB ==========

========== What is a Data ==========
Data can be considered as facts related to any object incosideration. 
ex. Name, Age, Height, Weight, Images and Files

========== What is a Database ==========
Databases are systematic collections of data. Can also be known as data stores.

========== What is SQL ==========
Relational Model is a type of database management system which defines database relationships in forms of tables aka relations.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for dealing with relational database. Used to Insert, Search, Update, and Delete database records. 

Relational databases are known as SQL databases because they are written in SQL.
It is the more rigid structured way of storing data. 
Will usally consists of two or more tables with columns and rows. 
Each row represents an entry, and each column sorts very specific information. 
The relationship between tables and fields types is call a schema. 
Schema must be clearly defined before a row can be added. 
This gives excellent organization but compromises flexability. 


========== What is NoSQL ==========
Non-relational DB are used when you're dealing with massive amounts of unstructured data. This type of DB offers greater flexibility. 

Think of non-relational databases as file folders, assembling related information of all types. This type of DB is known as schema-less. 

NoSQL stands for "Not only SQL", and allows you to treat data more flexibily. Instead of tables, this type of DB is document-oriented. This way, non-structured data (articles, photos, socialmedia data, videos, and content withing a post) can be stored in a single document. This does require more processing effort and storage. 

Common types of NoSQL DBs
	- key-value model: stores data in a schema-less way that consists of indexed keys and values
	- column store: stores data tables as columns rather than rows. 
	- document DB: key-value and a bag of chips. each document has its own data and unique key. great for storing, retrieving and managing data.
	- graph database - black magic... data that's interconnected and best represented as a graph?

========== SQL vs NoSQL ==========
Differences can be found in how DBs are build, type of information they store, and how the DB stores the data. 

Relational (SQL) databases utilize tables to organize structured data fields into defined columns.
Need to define schema prior to using
Rigid in structure
Harder to scale quickly
Excellent orginization
Compromises flexability

VS
Non-relational (NoSQL) databases store data ina single document file.
